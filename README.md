# Object-detection-model
This Python script uses OpenCV for real-time vehicle counting in videos. It employs background subtraction, contour detection, and centroid tracking to detect vehicles crossing a specified line. The system displays the count and draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles, ideal for traffic monitoring applications.
